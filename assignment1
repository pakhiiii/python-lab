# Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). 
#The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
for i in range (2000,3201):
 if(i%7==0 and i%5!=0):
    print(i,end=",")
2. Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers. The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
for j in range(5,11):
 fact=1
 for i in range(1,j+1):
  fact=fact*i
 print(fact,end=",")
 #3. With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that
# is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.
n=int(input("enter number"))
dict={}
for i in range(1,n+1):
    dict[i]=i*i
print(dict)
#4. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
#Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
#34,67,55,33,12,98
#Then, the output should be:
#['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
#('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')
inputnumbers = input("Enter comma-separated numbers: ")
numberslist = inputnumbers.split(',')
numberstuple = tuple(numberslist)
print(numberslist)
print(numberstuple)
